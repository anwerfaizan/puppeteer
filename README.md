# puppeteer
It is a javaScript based project in which I used pupeeteer. It opens the hackerrank site and adds moderators to the contests after login. It all happens automatically by using puppeteer. Learning- familiarity with async and await.
If you want to see the working of the project then open the code in vscode and run the code by using the command given on the top of the code.
